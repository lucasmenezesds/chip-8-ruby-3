# Extras

In order to be able to develop this project I had to review some Computer Science's topics.. So I decided to write some
notes so maybe this could be useful for someone ^ ^.

## About the project development

While developing this project, there were some articles and documents that helped me a lot, and I'll be listing it here.

The first article that was really helpful was
the [Guide to making a CHIP-8 emulator](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/), which gives you a
high-level guide to help you developing the interpreter.

Although, there were couple instructions that were quite confusing or wasn't working properly after I implemented, so I
used a second document, that
is [Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference](https://github.com/daniel5151/AC8E/blob/c2dbf92858055cc1c72e50727b3d244a92850df2/references/Cowgod's%20Chip-8%20Technical%20Reference.pdf)
, and it helped me finishing the first version of this project!

And lastly, there is another project that can help you A LOT, which is [Octo](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo).

You can use Octo's project to check if the rom you're loading into your emulator is running properly by cross-checking
it.

Besides that, the Octo's documentation is huge and way more complete that this one, so if you need a even more complete
documentation, I would recommend you to give a check [there](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo/tree/gh-pages/docs).

### Special Thanks

I would like to leave a special thanks to a friend that helped me a lot while I was developing this project, he shares a
lot of articles, different materials and taught me A LOT of things, and I really appropriate it.

Thank you very much for all the help [Ivsucram](https://github.com/Ivsucram)! If wasn't for you I would take way longer
to implement the first version of the project.
